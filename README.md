# Fundamental Algorithms

This repository contains implementations of well-known algorithms studied in the **Fundamental Algorithms** course.  
The goal is to explore algorithmic design, data structures, and graph theory through practical coding examples.

## ðŸ“š Topics Covered
- Sorting and Searching Algorithms  
- Recursion and Dynamic Programming  
- Graph Algorithms (BFS, DFS, Dijkstra, etc.)  
- Data Structures (Stacks, Queues, Trees, Heaps, Hash Tables)  
- Complexity Analysis and Optimization
